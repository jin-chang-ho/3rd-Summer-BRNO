This homework will focus on image processing and especially on working with homography. In the first two tasks (Homography #1 and # 2) you will learn how to work with homography within the opencv library and how to use it in further image processing.\n","\n","In the third task (Homography #3), the whole process is extended by another step, which will be a combination of the original image and the aligned image using homography. Using this step, you will learn how to easily modify images, much like video call applications (such as Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Snapchat, and more) do when various effects (sunglasses, hats, and so on) are added to the video.\n","\n","In the last task (Homography #4) you will use the same steps to place your own photo to a picture with a TV so that the resulting picture looks as realistic as possible.\n","\n","We hope that this homework will excite you, you will get a positive experience from it and it will give you a basic insight into the image processing.\n","\n","**Before you start filling in the assignment, download the necessary [photos](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ikiss/bissit21/images.zip) and upload them to your Colab Notebook (Folder icon on the left > File icon with the up arrow).**\n","\n","## How to submit\n","* Create a **copy** of this notebook. \n","* Finish the assigment.\n","* Export the notebook to `.pdf` (File > Print).\n","* Send it to ikiss@fit.vutbr.cz (Add the pdf in the attachment)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_OTDgzjaxA2t"},"source":["## Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"L9-7zlK65xFR"},"source":["import cv2\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","%matplotlib inline  \n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tzkbM2Q7xEV7"},"source":["## Image helper functions\n","\n","The following code contains two functions for image manipulation.

The second function displays image(s) using `pyplot`.
