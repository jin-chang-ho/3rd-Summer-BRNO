MSA is usually used for biological sequences as protein's amino acid sequence, DNA or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a linkage and are descended from a common ancestor. Extracting patterns from MSA may be helpful in the area of protein engineering for synthesize of more stable proteins. \n","\n","For you now, **the most important takeaways are**:\n","* MSA is a set of sequences of same length.\n","* Each character in sequence encodes amino acid or there is special character for gap position '-'. The biological meaning behind the gap is an insertion of amino acid during evolution that is not provided in other species (may enhance protein properties). The **X** position encodes an unexplored residues introduced by the error in measurement.   \n","* Each column in the MSA encodes relation between proteins in the alignment.\n","* More conserved positions encode stable and important regions for protein function. \n","* **The query sequence** is our selected protein of interest.\n","\n","Our small MSA looks like:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_KzXCODJhX0H","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1626237671562,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Changho Jin","photoUrl":"","userId":"15940163417036900361"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","msa = {\"query\"    : \"AGCWW-N-IIPM\",\n","       \"protein2\" : \"AG-WWCN-IIPM\",\n","       \"protein3\" : \"AG-WWCN-IIP-\",\n","       \"protein4\" : \"AG-WWCN-IIP-\",\n","       \"protein5\" : \"AG---C--I-P-\",\n","       \"protein6\" : \"AG-WXC-PIIPM\",\n","       \"protein7\" : \"AGCW-C-PXIPM\"}"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ooHpSI7XieaN"},"source":["One of usually used pipeline for MSA preprocessing and **your task** is given as follow:\n","1.
